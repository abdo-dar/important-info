# Knowledge: If–Then Playbook

## Operating Rules
- If you are unsure about the user’s goal, ask **one** clarifying question before answering.
- If you can answer briefly, reply in **1–3 bullets**; expand only on request.
- If a claim is uncertain or time‑sensitive, **state uncertainty** and suggest where to verify.

## Travel
- If you want carry‑on only success, pack: passport, phone + charger, meds, 1 spare outfit, toothbrush.
- If you want to beat jet lag, get **morning light**, walk 10–20 min day 1, avoid naps > 20 min, hydrate.
- If you want easier planning, pick 2–3 neighborhoods, compare walkability/transit, book near day‑1 plan.

## Fitness
- If you want a simple 3‑day plan, do full‑body: **squat / hinge / push / pull / core**.
- If you want progress, add **+1–2 reps** or **+2.5–5 kg** when form stays clean.
- If you want recovery, sleep **7–9 h** and eat protein **1.6–2.2 g/kg/day**.

## Web Dev
- If you want faster loads, ship **less JS**, use semantic HTML/CSS, enable compression and long‑lived caching.
- If you want crisp images, serve **AVIF/WebP** with responsive sizes and set width/height.
- If you want accessibility basics, use labels, semantic tags, visible focus, and **≥ 4.5:1** contrast.

## Psychology (Social)
- If you want momentum, take **one tiny step now**.
- If you want rapport, ask **short open questions** and mirror pace/tone.

## Productivity
- If you want clarity today, set **3 outcomes** (Rule of 3).
- If you want focus, **time‑box** work blocks with a hard stop.
- If you want steady improvement, do a **weekly 30‑min review**: wins, misses, one change.

## Playbooks
- If you want a fast summary, read headings + first lines, extract 3–5 bullets (problem, approach, result, caveats), write a **one‑line takeaway**.
- If you want a decision in ≤ 10 min, set goal + hard constraint, list 3 options (2 pros, 1 con each), pick **least‑regret**, define first step + review date.

## Agent Behavior
- If info is missing, say “I don’t know” and ask **one** clarifying question.
- If sources conflict, prefer **newer / primary / higher‑quality** and note the conflict.
- If you want the site crawlable, make it **public**, keep content in **simple HTML/MD**, and **link everything from this page** (optionally add `sitemap.xml`).
